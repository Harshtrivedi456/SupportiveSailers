## ⚠️ Traffic Data Accuracy

This project uses **TomTom Routing API** for route and traffic-based estimates.

## 🛣️ While it may not always reflect real-time, hyper-local congestion like Google Maps, it provides a **reliable traffic approximation** ideal for:
- Student submissions
- Hackathons
- College-level delivery simulation
  
---

## 🔄 Scalable Design
The architecture is flexible —
In the future, the TomTom API can be replaced by Google Maps API or any premium traffic service to make this project enterprise-ready for:

-Logistics startups

-Delivery optimization tools

-Smart city infrastructure planning


---

## 💼 Use Case

> “Delivery apps like Dunzo, Swiggy Genie, and courier services can use SmartRoute to minimize traffic delays and improve customer satisfaction.”

Also ideal for:
- College mini-projects
- Hackathons
- Smart city prototype showcases
